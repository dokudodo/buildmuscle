Good Morning America is a popular morning talk show that has been on the air since 1975. Over the years, the show has had many different hosts, each bringing their own unique style and personality to the show. In this article, we will take a closer look at the history of Good Morning America hosts, from the early days of the show to the present.</p><h2>Early Days of Good Morning America</h2><p>The first episode of Good Morning America aired on November 3, 1975. The original hosts of the show were David Hartman and Nancy Dussault. Hartman was a former actor and had previously hosted a local talk show in New York City. Dussault was a Broadway actress and singer. Together, they helped to establish the format of the show, which included news, weather, and interviews with guests.</p><p>Over the years, the show went through many changes, including different hosts. In 1980, Joan Lunden joined the show as a co-host. Lunden had previously worked as a reporter and anchor for ABC News. She brought a more serious tone to the show and helped to establish Good Morning America as a legitimate news program. Lunden stayed with the show for 17 years, making her the longest-serving host in the show's history.</p><h2>The 90s and 2000s</h2><p>In the 1990s, Good Morning America underwent another transformation. Charles Gibson and Lisa McRee became the show's new hosts. Gibson had previously worked as a news anchor for ABC News, while McRee was a former local news anchor. Together, they helped to modernize the show and make it more relevant to younger viewers. Their tenure on the show was relatively short, with Gibson leaving in 1998 and McRee departing a year later.</p><p>In 1999, Diane Sawyer joined Good Morning America as a co-host. Sawyer had previously worked as a correspondent for ABC News and had also worked as a co-anchor of Primetime Live. She brought a more serious tone to the show, but also had a fun and playful side. Sawyer left the show in 2009 to become an anchor for World News.</p><h2>Recent Hosts of Good Morning America</h2><p>In recent years, Good Morning America has had a number of different hosts. Robin Roberts joined the show in 2005 as a newsreader, but quickly became a co-host. Roberts had previously worked as a sports anchor for ESPN and had also worked for Good Morning America in the 1990s. She brought a lot of energy and enthusiasm to the show, and quickly became a fan favorite.</p><p>In 2010, George Stephanopoulos joined Good Morning America as a co-host. Stephanopoulos had previously worked as a political analyst for ABC News and had also worked as a co-anchor of World News. He brought a more serious tone to the show, but also had a fun and playful side.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Good Morning America has been on the air for almost 50 years, and over that time, it has had many different hosts. Each host has brought their own unique style and personality to the show, helping to make it one of the most popular morning talk shows on television. While the show has undergone many changes over the years, one thing has remained constant: its commitment to bringing viewers the latest news and information in a fun and engaging way.</p><p>We hope you have enjoyed reading about the history of Good Morning America hosts.
