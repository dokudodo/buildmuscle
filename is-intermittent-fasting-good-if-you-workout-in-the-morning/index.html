During the fasting period, you are allowed to drink water, coffee, or tea, but you cannot consume any calories. The purpose of intermittent fasting is to give your body a break from digesting food and allow it to focus on repairing and rejuvenating itself. This can lead to numerous health benefits, such as weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation.</p><p>If you workout in the morning, you may be wondering if intermittent fasting is a good idea. After all, if you are not eating before your workout, won't you be low on energy?

Start with a shorter fasting period.</h3><p>If you are new to intermittent fasting, it's a good idea to start with a shorter fasting period, such as 12-14 hours.

Drink plenty of water.</h3><p>During your fasting period, it's important to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water, and consider adding some electrolytes to your water to help maintain your energy levels.</p><h3>3.

This will help ensure that you have enough energy to complete your workout.</p><h3>3. Stay hydrated.</h3><p>During your fasting period, make sure to drink plenty of water.

Make sure to give your body enough rest and recovery time in between workouts.</p><h3>3. Stay consistent.</h3><p>Consistency is key when it comes to intermittent fasting and working out. Make sure to stick to your fasting protocol and workout schedule as much as possible to see the best results.</p><h2 id="solution">Solution</h2><p>If you are working out in the morning and following an intermittent fasting protocol, there are a few things you can do to make it work:</p><h3>1.
